    <h1>HTML이란?</h1>
    The HyperText Markup Language or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">HTML</a> is <strong>the standard <u>markup</u> language</strong> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.Payment Request standardizes an API to allow merchants (i.e., web sites selling physical or digital goods) to utilize one or more payment methods with minimal integration.<p style="margin-top:40px"> Browsers facilitate the payment flow between merchant and user.</p> Payment Method Identifiers defines payment method identifiers and how they are validated, and, where applicable, minted and formally registered with the W3C. The Web Applications Working Group invites implementations of a Candidate Recommendation Snapshot of Web Share API. This specification defines an API for sharing text,&lt; img /&gt links and other,&lt; input /&gt content to an arbitrary destination of the user’s choice. The available share targets are not specified here; they are provided by the user agent. They could, for example, be apps, websites or contacts.
    HTML uses special codes to support content for common symbols not found on keyboards, as well as in situations where the symbol itself serves a dual purpose in HTML as both a control character and a display character.To add a letter, number, or special symbol to the displayed text of a webpage, use either the HTML number or the HTML name of the symbol.
    For example, one way to display the text ¡Buenos días! using HTML codes is:
  </body>
</html>
